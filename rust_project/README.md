# COP4610 Project <N>: <Short Title> (Rust)

## How to Compile & Run
```bash
# on linprog (with Rust installed):
cargo build --release
./target/release/proj2

# if using the Makefile wrapper:
make
./bin/proj2
```

## Notes
- Keep binaries out of the repository; only source and config files should be committed.
- Fill in the same documentation sections as the C template (division of labor before/after, file listing, bugs, logs, meetings).
